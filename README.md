# Nebrija "Bedeutung"

This repository contains the statistical analyses conducted for the study "*Discourse construction mechanisms: An eye-tracking study on L1, L2, and heritage speakers of Spanish*".

To ensure the successful execution of the scripts, a specific folder structure is required. The raw data should be stored in `0_data/1_raw_data`. The data preparation is carried out by running `description.R` first. Once the data has been preprocessed, the main statistical analysis can be performed using `analysis.R`.
